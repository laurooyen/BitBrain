# BitBrain

An AI project for maths developed by Lauro Oyen and Jonathan Swinnen.

The goal of this project is to recognize handwritten digits and mathematical operators in an image. Our program then extracts the bounding boxes and classifies the symbols using artificial intelligence. The backend that does these calculations is implemented in C++ for optimal performance. The frontend is implemented using a Node.js server such that it can be used from a web browser on desktop and mobile platforms. A screenshot of the WebApp can be seen below.
